# Sales-and-Visitor-Forecasting
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews for restaurants and cafés using deep learning techniques. It aims to help administrators better understand customer feedback and predict future performance through sentiment analysis and time-series forecasting.

The system classifies review text into sentiment categories and displays sentiment confidence scores for administrative monitoring. Additionally, it forecasts next-day sales and visitor counts based on historical data.

Problem Statement

Customer-written reviews do not always align with the numerical ratings they select, leading to inaccurate evaluations. Moreover, administrators often lack analytical tools to interpret customer sentiment trends and anticipate future demand. This project addresses these issues by combining text-based sentiment analysis with predictive time-series modeling.
